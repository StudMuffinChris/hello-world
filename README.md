# hello-world
Just another repository
As part of learning how to use GitHub I get to share some info about myself; this is slightly intimidating given I am entirely self-taught in matters of coding. I was drawn into the world of computers after seeing a video on the internet of the AI Sophia-- her technology was incredible and I hope to work with robotics in the future. Overall, I would love to help work on coding and technology that helps humans treat or manage disease or make advancements in biomedical engineering.
